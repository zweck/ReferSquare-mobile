This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run cordova:browser`
3. profit!

You _may_ need to run `node rebuild node-sass` but otherwise the above is all you _should_ need.

To run in the simulator you can run `npm run cordova:ios`
